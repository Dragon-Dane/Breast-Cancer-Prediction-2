a) At first, we import the libraries needed for our Script.
	> NumPy is needed for Array usage in the program and also conversion of DataFrames.
	> MatPlotLib is needed for plotting Graphs between various data to find out their dependencies..
	> Pandas is needed for it's utility of using DataFrames for proper visualization and storage of datasets from CSV Files.
	> SKLearn is needed for it's Machine Learning algorithms for data analysis.

b) Now, we load the dataset into our DataFrame and then split and convert them into two different Arrays required for Training and Testing the dataset.

c) Since this is a Machine Learning problem to classify and predict data into two categories, we use the K-Nearest Neighbour Model for classification. 
	> We find out the optimal value of "K" by plotting an accuracy graph. We then use that value of "K" for final prediction of the data. 

d) Accuracy is also tested upon the Train Set and the Test Set.

e) We then implement K-Fold Cross-Validation to stike off any over-fitting or under-fitting of data in our model and make it a suitable and generalized one. 
	> We also display the Mean Cross-Validation score at the end.

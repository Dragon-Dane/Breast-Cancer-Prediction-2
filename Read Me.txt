Biopsy Data on Breast Cancer Patients

Description
This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. He assessed biopsies of breast tumours for 699 patients up to 15 July 1992; each of nine attributes has been scored on a scale of 1 to 10, and the outcome is also known. There are 699 rows and 11 columns.

Usage
biopsy

Format
This data frame contains the following columns:

ID

C2
uniformity of cell size.

C3

C4
marginal adhesion.

C5
single epithelial cell size.

C6
bare nuclei (16 values are missing).

C7
bland chromatin.

C8
normal nucleoli.

C9
mitoses.
